          <p> The beloved tale of Star Wars is one that almost didn't happen.  Countless
          stories that we could have been robbed of without ever even knowing it.
          Generations may never have known about the tales of the Skywalker family.</p>
          <p> This is the tale of how Star Wars almost didn't happen.</p>

        <div class="hideme columns small-8 medium-10 large-12 evens"><p>After the premiere of his first feature length film, THX 1138,
          George Lucas began to explore the possibility of a Space Western.  He wanted to
          base it on Flash Gordon, which he loved as a child.  He was never able to secure
          the rights to it so he decided to write his own space fantasy.</p></div>
        <div class="hideme columns small-8 medium-10 large-12 odds"><p>He began developing his Space Opera, which he would call “The
          Star Wars” while he worked on his next movie, American Grafitti.  After American
          Graffiti premiered, he began to focus his attention on Star Wars writing non stop
          as ideas continued to flow.</p></div>
        <div class="hideme columns small-8 medium-10 large-12 evens"><p>He borrowed ideas from Tarzan movies, Jules Verne, Kurusawa
          films, and even The Wizard of Oz in order to create his space opera.  He finished
          his 13 page treatment in April of 1973 and began to shop around for a studio to
          financially back it.</p></div>
        <div class="hideme columns small-8 medium-10 large-12 odds"><p>After being rejected by United Artists, Universal Studios, and
          Walt Disney Studios, Lucas and his producer, Gary Kurtz, shopped it to 20th
          Century Fox.  They head of the studio, Alan Ladd, didn’t think much of the story,
          but he saw talent in George Lucas and decided to financially back it based on
          that faith.  By June, the deal was signed.  Star Wars would be backed.</p></div>
        <figure id="capture">
          <img id="sd" src="images/sd.png" alt="Star Destroyer">
          <img id="br" src="images/runner.png" alt="Blockade Runner">
        </figure>
        <div class="hideme columns small-8 medium-10 large-12 evens"><p>Over the next year, Lucas would rewrite the treatment four
          times before fleshing out the ideas.  He has said that “searching for just the
          right ingredients, characters and storyline. It's always been what you might call
          a good idea in search of a story.”</p></div>
        <div class="hideme columns small-8 medium-10 large-12 odds"><p>He continued to write and in January of 1975, it began to shape
          up into the Star Wars we would eventually come to know.  The Force was developed
          as a mystical energy field that Jedi and Sith could tap into.  Characters were
          developed although appearances weren’t yet nailed down.</p></div>
        <div class="hideme columns small-8 medium-10 large-12 evens"><p>Lucas hired conceptual artist Ralph McQuarrie to create
          paintings of certain scenes at this time.  When Lucas delivered the screenplay to
          the studio, he included these paintings.</p></div>
        <div class="hideme columns small-8 medium-10 large-12 odds"><p>20th century Fox approved a budget of $8.25 million and, due to
          the success of American Graffiti, allowed Lucas to keep the rights to any sequels
          and merchandising.  The studio thought the movie would do all right but didn’t
          think much of a future for the Star Wars.</p></div>
        <div class="hideme columns small-8 medium-10 large-12 evens"><p>George Lucas would form his own visual effects company after
          learning that Fox’s had been disbanded.  This company is Industrial Light and
          Magic.  ILM would pioneer and create it’s own technology in order to achieve the
          shots that George Lucas wanted.</p></div>
        <div class="hideme columns small-8 medium-10 large-12 odds"><p>Kurtz initially scouted out the Phillipines as a location, as
          Lucas wanted Tatooine to be a jungle planet.  After Lucas worried about filming
          in the jungle, he refined his idea to make Tatooine the desert planet we now know
          and Kurtz found Tunisia as the perfect location.</p></div>
        <div class="hideme columns small-8 medium-10 large-12 evens"><p>Casting began and many relatively unknown people would soon
          shoot up to stardom.  Mark Hamill had a sitcom but would skyrocket after Star
          Wars.  Carrie Fisher was known but not by anything important.  Harrison Ford had
          minor roles in films but was primarily a carpenter.  He would eventually become
          the biggest star of all of them.</p></div>
        <div class="hideme columns small-8 medium-10 large-12 odds"><p>After Geoffrey Unsworth dropped out of his contract to be the
          cinematographer for Star Wars, Lucas hired Gilbert Taylor because he was
          impressed by his work on Dr Strangelove.  After filming began, there was an
          immediate clash in ideals as to how the film should be shot.  </p></div>
        <div class="hideme columns small-8 medium-10 large-12 evens"><p>Lucas came up as an independent filmmaker and was used to
          doing many things on his own.  Taylor objected to Lucas’s decisions.  Lucas
          would tell him he wanted something lit a certain way and Taylor would deny him
          that.  He told Lucas that he would do things the way he wanted, which is a slap
          in the face to any filmmaker.  </p></div>
        <figure id="ds">
          <img src="images/deathstar.png" alt="Death Star">
        </figure>
        <div class="hideme columns small-8 medium-10 large-12 odds"><p>Star Wars would face other problems during filming.  Props
          and equipment would break almost as a routine and there was an extremely rare
          thunderstorm that happened during the first week of filming.  All of this
          threatened to derail the project.  Fox executives were getting angry that they
          haven’t seen a return on their investment yet.</p></div>
        <div class="hideme columns small-8 medium-10 large-12 evens"><p>After Tunisia was finished, the production moved to Elstree
          Studios, where the sets would be built for the Death Star.  The studio workers
          didn’t care about the project and did things very half-ass.  They took breaks
          when they felt like it and joked around about the movie being a kids show.
          Taylor began to shine by creating the in-wall lighting system because
          everything was so dark.</p></div>
        <div class="hideme columns small-8 medium-10 large-12 odds"><p>Ladd remained the only executive at Fox Studios that
          supported the project, even pushing for a higher budget.  Executives were pushy,
          production was messy, and equipment was faulty.  Lucas was diagnosed with
          hypertension and exhaustion.  His doctor warned him that if he kept going like
          this, he would have a heart attack.  Lucas had to keep going though.  His vision
          was getting close.</p></div>
        <div class="hideme columns small-8 medium-10 large-12 evens"><p>Star Wars was initially supposed to be released for Christmas
          of 1976 but the post-production process and continued butting of heads set the
          film date back to Summer of 1977.</p></div>
        <div class="hideme columns small-8 medium-10 large-12 odds"><p>During post-production, the editor, John Jympson, decided not
          to cut the film the way Lucas wanted.  He did things his own way and the movie
          looked terrible.  Lucas replaced him when he refused to recut it and hired Paul
          Hirsch and Richard Chew to recut it.  He even had his then-wife, Marcia Lucas,
          recut some scenes.</p></div>
        <div class="hideme columns small-8 medium-10 large-12 evens"><p>In February of 1977, a very rough version of the film was
          shown to select directors and Fox executives.  The special effects were
          unfinished and it was met with very mixed reactions.  Steven Spielberg was the
          only director who enjoyed the film but felt the lukewarm reaction of others
          was due to the unfinished special effects.  Fox executives liked the version
          but increased the budget of the film to 11 million so that Lucas could finish
          the special effects.</p></div>
        <div class="hideme columns small-8 medium-10 large-12 odds"><p>ILM created their own technologies to finish the effects.
          Stop motion effects, optical tricks, and green screen rigs were developed and
          used to make these shots work right.  The production was finished mere weeks
          before the release date of May 25, 1977.</p></div>
        <div class="hideme columns small-8 medium-10 large-12 evens"><p>The stress was well worth it and Star Wars launched into an
          international phenomenon.  It is a household name and has been the source
          material of seven movies, with four more in various stages of development,
          multiple TV shows, videogames, comics, books, toys, and every other possible
          merchandise you can think of.  Very few people believed in this vision but
          Lucas was determined and it skyrocketed him to success.</p></div>
